Review,Liked
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.,0
It is worth the drive.,1
I probably would not go here again.,0
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,0
"Service was average, not bad but not great.",2
"Average experience, nothing stood out.",2
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
Waited and waited and waited.,0
"Some parts were good, others were meh.",2
"The place was fine, but wouldn't rush back.",2
But then they came back cold.,0
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!,1
"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.",1
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.",1
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!,1
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,0
"Some parts were good, others were meh.",2
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.",0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
I'm not eating here!,0
"Ambience was decent, but I've seen better.",2
These were so good we ordered them twice.,1
"It was okay, nothing that stood out.",2
Don't bother coming here.,0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,1
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
"Some parts were good, others were meh.",2
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.",0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.,1
The food came out at a good pace.,1
The waitress and manager are so friendly.,1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,0
"The place was fine, but wouldn't rush back.",2
It was an ordinary dining experience.,2
"Neither good nor bad, just a regular meal.",2
"Mediocre experience, nothing to complain or praise.",2
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.",1
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
"As for the service, I thought it was good.",1
"Ambience was decent, but I've seen better.",2
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,0
Pretty awesome place.,1
"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.",1
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
What a mistake.,0
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!,1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.,0

The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
The food is good.,1
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.,0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.,0
"If you're not familiar, check it out.",1

"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.",1

"Had an average experience, might try again.",2
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.",0
"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.",0
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",0
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0
AN HOUR... seriously?,0
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!,1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
Highly recommended.,1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,0
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.,1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.",0
"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!",0

"My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.",1
Food arrived quickly!,1
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.",0
I was seated immediately.,1
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,1
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.",0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
We loved the biscuits!!!,1
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.",0
"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.",0

this place is good.,1

"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.",1
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,0
There was hardly any meat.,0

"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.",1
"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.",0

Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.,1
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.",0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,0
