"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.",1
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,1
Awful service.,0
